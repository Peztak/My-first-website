	<h1><b><u>CONFIDENTIALITY POLICY</u></b></h1>
<p class="title"><b><u>1. AIMS & OBJECTIVES</u></b></p>
<p><br>Employees and personnel of Webrunning and its subsidiary and
associate companies  have a duty of maintaining the
confidentiality of information received by them in the course of their
employment or engagement. This Confidentiality Policy documents the
confidentiality and non-disclosure duties and obligations of the employees and
personnel of Webrunning.</br>
<br>The employees and personnel of Webrunning will, in the course of their
employment and engagement, become aware of and possess information of
the Webrunning or of third parties disclosed to the Webrunning that is not
generally known. This may include information which if disclosed could
jeopardise the interests of the Webrunning. It may also include commercial
trade secrets disclosure of which could harm the interests of the Webrunning.</br>
<br>All employees and personnel of the Webrunning have a duty to keep such
information strictly confidential and to use it only for the proper purposes in
accordance with the law.</br></p>
<p class="title"><b><u>2. PURPOSE</u></b></p>
<p><br>The purpose of this Confidentiality Policy is to lay down the principles that
must be observed by all who work with the Webrunning and have access to
confidential information.</br>
<br>This policy, where relevant, should be read in conjunction with the
appointment letter and/or employment contract applicable to Webrunning
employees and personnel, and other work rules, policies and procedures
applicable to Webrunning employees and personnel.</br></p>
<p class="title"><b><u>3. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</u></b></p>
<p><br>Confidential information includes any information which is not publicly known.
It can concern technology, business, finance, transaction or other affairs of a
company. It includes information which is commercially valuable such as trade
secrets or business information, as well as personal information.</br>
<br>Examples of confidential information include but are not limited to: any
document, discovery, invention, improvement, patent specification,
formulations, plans, ideas, books, accounts, data, reports, drafts of
documents of all kinds, correspondence, client information, lists and files,
decisions, information about employees, strategies, drawings,
recommendations, designs, office precedents, policies and procedures,
budget and financial information in any form, i.e. physical, electronic, electromagnetic or otherwise.</br>
<br>Confidential information to do with unpublished inventions can be particularly
sensitive. Disclosure of an invention before a patent application is filed will
cause irreversible loss of intellectual property rights to the owner of the
invention. Even after a patent application is filed, care must be taken not to
disclose improvements to the invention. Trade secret protection will also be
lost through open disclosure of the secret.</br></p>
<p class="title"><b><u>4. PRINCIPLES</u></b></p>
<p><br>Webrunning expects all of its employees and personnel to handle all
confidential information in a sensitive and professional manner. Webrunning
employees and personnel are under an obligation not to gain access or
attempt to gain access to information which they are not authorised to have.
The Webrunning, however, recognises the importance of an open culture with
clear communication and accountability. The Webrunning wishes to maintain
personal and organisational safety and expects all employees and personnel
to handle confidential information in a way which protects organisational
security.</br>
<br>The purpose of confidentiality is essentially two fold. Firstly it protects
sensitive or confidential information of the Webrunning and its clients and
customers. Secondly, in order for the Webrunning to be effective, Webrunning
employees and personnel must be able to share information and knowledge,
and therefore confidentiality is necessary as a condition of trust.
The best protection against breaches in confidentiality is to keep the number
of employees and personnel who have access to sensitive information to a
necessary minimum.</br>
<br>Intentional, repeated, accidental, or unauthorised disclosure of any
confidential information by any member of staff will be subject to disciplinary
action. Any such disciplinary action will take account of the confidential and
possible sensitive nature of the information and will make sure that in dealing
with it, no further breaches of confidentiality take place.</br></p>
<p class="title"><b><u>5. MAINTENANCE OF CONFIDENTIALITY & NON-DISCLOSURE</u></b></p>
<p><br>Webrunning employees and personnel:</br>
<br>1 must keep confidential all confidential information;</br>
<br>2 may use confidential information solely for the purposes of
performing their duties as an employee of the Webrunning; and</br>
<br>3 may only disclose confidential information to persons who are
aware that the confidential information must be kept confidential
and who have a need to know (but only to the extent that each
person has a need to know).</br>
<br>The employee’s and personnel’s obligation of maintaining confidentiality and
non-disclosure does not extend to confidential information that is required to
be disclosed by the employee pursuant to an order of a Court or any statutory
authority. The employee or person will promptly notify the Company of any
such requirement to enable the Company to take necessary action as
deemed fit by the Company in the circumstances.</br>
<br>At the end of the period of employment, Webrunning employees and personnel
must return to the Webrunning:</br>
<br>1 all confidential information in material form;</br>
<br>2 those parts of all notes and other records in whatsoever form,
based on or incorporating confidential information;</br>
<br>3 all copies of confidential information and notes and other
records based on or incorporating confidential information; and</br>
<br>4 all of Webrunning property and assets,
in the possession or control of the Webrunning employee or personnel.
The obligation of maintaining confidentiality and non-disclosure will continue
even after the end of the period of employment or engagement in respect of
all confidential information.</br>
<br>Any employee found to be in breach of this confidentiality and non-disclosure
obligation, whilst employed by the Webrunning will be disciplined, and in
serious instances, dismissed. Any ex-employee found to be in breach of this
confidentiality obligation may be subject to legal action being taken against
them, dependent upon the circumstances of the breach, including cancellation
/ withdrawal of any or all benefits if extended to the ex-employee by the
Company.</br>
<br>This policy will operate in conjunction with the contract of employment or letter
of appointment for Webrunning employees and personnel.</br></p>
<p class="title"><b><u>6. NEED TO KNOW</u></b></p>
<p><br>Confidential information is only to be disclosed on a "need to know" basis,
only when the information is necessary to the employee for performing his or
her employment duties effectively.</br></p>
<p class="title"><b><u>7. CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH INFORMATION CAN BE DISCLOSED</u></b></p>
<p><br>1 With the written consent of his/her reporting superior of not lower than
Tier 4 and for a particular purpose.</br>
<br>2 If the information is required by or under a Court order or of a statutory
authority, the employee or person will promptly notify the Company of
any such requirement to enable the Company to take necessary action
as deemed fit by the Company in the circumstances.</br>
<br>3 Where disclosure can be justified for any other purpose. This is usually
for the protection of the public and is likely to be in relation to the
prevention and detection of serious crime. A request for information by
the police must be carefully considered.</br>
<br>The Webrunning employee must be able to justify any decision when
information has been disclosed.</br></p>
<p class="title"><b><u>8. STORAGE OF DATA</u></b></p>
<p><br>No written document containing confidential information must be left
visible where it can be read by anyone.</br> 
<br>This includes telephone messages, computer prints, letters and other documents. All hardware
containing confidential information must be housed in a secure
environment.</br>
<br>Security precautions must be taken in accordance with
the Webrunning Policy and Procedures.</br></p>
<p class="title"><b><u>9. THE MEDIA</u></b></p>
<p><br>Confidential information must not be passed on to members of the
press, or other media communications without the written consent of
his reporting superior of not lower than Tier 4 and for a particular
purpose.</br></p> 
<br>All requests from the media must be dealt with under the Webrunning's procedure for handling media queries.</br>
<p class="title"><b><u>10. DISPOSAL OF INFORMATION</u></b></p>
<p><br>All media containing confidential information must be disposed off in a
manner that ensures that information is not disclosed to an
unauthorised person.</br></p>
